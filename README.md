# Tab Selector

Select a tab's parent, siblings, children, or the whole family. If you often open lots of links in new tabs, so many that it gets a bit hard to manage, this simple tool can come in handy.

## About this extension

Tab Selector adds a context menu that appears when you right-click a tab (a.k.a. the target tab). The menu items are:

- **Go to parent** &mdash; Go to the tab where the target was spawned from.
- **Select tab family** &mdash; Select the parent tab and all its descendants, including the target.
- **Select tab and siblings** &mdash; Basically "Select tab family", excluding the parent tab.
- **Select tab and children** &mdash; Select the target and its descendants.
- **Select children** &mdash; Select the target's descendants.

For every tab selected, its children (tabs spawned from it) will also be selected, and their children, and so on. In other words, selection of tab descendants is always implied.

### Why would I want this?

Have you ever &ndash; while browsing or researching on sites like Wikipedia, Reddit, Amazon, StackOverflow, etc. &ndash; found yourself shooting off into topical tangents that quickly grow into large clusters of tabs, and wishing you could instantly select an entire tangent to destroy, bookmark or move to a new window? Yeah me too.

### Tree Style Tab exists. Why Tab Selector?

Yes, [Tree Style Tab](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/tree-style-tab/) is a great addon that visually depicts all tab "family trees" before your very eyes. But maybe it's a bit much, maybe it's not your style (heh), maybe it doesn't provide the specific tab-handling option you need from a different extension.

Maybe you just need something lightweight that lets you do one thing &ndash; select related (ha!) tabs &ndash; so you can do whatever else you want with them. This is here it.
